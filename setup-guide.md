## What Is a Custom Agent?

A custom agent is a specialized version of ChatGPT with:

* Custom rules and tone
* Optional knowledge files (PDFs, docs, FAQs)
* Optional tools (web browsing, data analysis, image generation)

You can use it for support, tutoring, internal tools, or personal productivity.
